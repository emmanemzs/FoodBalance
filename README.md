# Food Balance

**Food Balance** is a visual meal composition tool built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Chart.js**. It helps users understand the nutritional balance of their meals by displaying a real-time pie chart based on selected food items.

The app includes pre-made food options for **breakfast**, **lunch**, and **dinner**, each categorized by their nutritional group: fruits, vegetables, meats, and grains. As users add items to their plate, the pie chart updates to reflect the current balance. Users can also increase food quantities or reset the chart at any time.
